This curriculum was largely taken and/or adapted from "Code This Game!" by Meg Ray.

This is sorted into days, then steps. Each day should have a folder, with multiple
steps in each folder. These are formatted as s (for step) followed by the step number and
a small description.

Each step has notes at the top for things that the teacher should know,
and anything added in that step is between two lines of stars.

An Overview is availiable in plan.txt
